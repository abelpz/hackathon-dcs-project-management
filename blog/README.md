# Biblical Translation Project Management System

## Overview

This project is a translation project management system designed to work with Door43 Content Service (DCS), an open-source GitHub platform specifically focused on biblical and religious content translation. The system integrates with DCS's API (git.door43.org) to facilitate the management and coordination of biblical translation projects.

## Current Use Case: Facilitating Minority Language Bible Translation

This system addresses a specific need: enabling Bible translation for minority language communities through strategic intermediary languages.

**The Challenge**: Many minority language translators don't have access to biblical source language expertise (Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic), making direct translation impossible.

**Our Solution**: We provide comprehensive "Book Translation Packages" that enable translators to work from a strategic language they understand (e.g., Spanish, Portuguese) to their minority language without requiring knowledge of the original biblical languages.

### Book Translation Package Components

Each package contains six essential resources for translators:

1. **Literal Translation of the Book for Translators ({lang}_glt)** - A version that closely follows the structure of the original language
2. **Simplified Translation of the Book for Translators ({lang}_gst)** - An easier-to-understand version with simplified grammar and vocabulary
3. **Translation Notes ({lang}_tn)** - Detailed explanatory notes from translation consultants to aid translators with difficult passages
4. **Translation Dictionary ({lang}_tw)** - A specialized dictionary covering theological terms, proper names, and culturally challenging concepts
5. **Translation Academy ({lang}_ta)** - Educational articles about grammar, translation principles, and decision-making guidance
6. **Translation Questions ({lang}_tq)** - Verse-by-verse comprehension questions to verify translation clarity and naturalness

## Comprehensive 8-Milestone Translation Process

Our organization follows a structured 8-milestone process for creating a Book Translation Package for each book of the Bible. Each milestone has specific objectives, methodologies, quality standards, and deliverables.
