# Book Translation Package Production Process

This document describes the established 8-milestone process used for creating Book Translation Packages. The Biblical Translation Project Management System we're developing will be designed to support and optimize this process.

## Process Overview

The Book Translation Package Production Process consists of 8 distinct milestones, each with specific objectives, participants, methodologies, and deliverables:

### Milestone 1: Drafting Phase
The initial creation of both literal and simplified translations from source texts.

### Milestone 2: Initial Review Phase
Peer and team reviews of the drafted translations to identify and address issues.

### Milestone 3: Technical Validation Phase
Verification of formatting, technical standards, and structural integrity of the translations.

### Milestone 4: Alignment Phase
Establishing connections between corresponding parts of the literal and simplified translations.

### Milestone 5: Supporting Resources Translation Phase
Creation of translation notes, dictionary entries, and comprehension questions.

### Milestone 6: Harmonization Phase
Ensuring consistency across all components of the Book Translation Package.

### Milestone 7: Expert Review Phase
Comprehensive review by language and theological experts to verify accuracy and clarity.

### Milestone 8: Technical Finalization Phase
Final formatting, packaging, and preparation for distribution.

## Repository Infrastructure

The translation process is supported by a robust repository infrastructure that organizes all translation resources within Git repositories hosted on the Door43 Content Service (DCS) platform. This infrastructure exists independently of our project management application but will be integrated with it.

### Repository Organization

Resources are organized under language-specific organizations within DCS (e.g., `es-419_gl` for Latin American Spanish). Each component of the Book Translation Package is maintained in its own dedicated repository:

- **Simplified Books**: `es-419_gl/es-419_gst` 
- **Literal Books**: `es-419_gl/es-419_glt`
- **Translation Notes**: `es-419_gl/es-419_tn`
- **Translation Dictionary**: `es-419_gl/es-419_tw`
- **Translation Academy**: `es-419_gl/es-419_ta`
- **Translation Questions**: `es-419_gl/es-419_tq`

### Benefits of the Repository Structure

This repository structure provides several key benefits for the translation process:

1. **Parallel Work Streams**: Different teams can work simultaneously on different components (e.g., literal translation, simplified translation, and notes).

2. **Robust Version Control**: All changes are tracked with complete history, allowing for easy rollback and comparison between versions.

3. **Distributed Collaboration**: Team members in different locations can contribute to the same project through Git's distributed nature.

4. **Quality Control**: Branch protection rules and pull request reviews ensure that all contributions meet quality standards before integration.

5. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each component has its own repository, allowing specialized teams to focus on their areas of expertise.

6. **Integration at Key Milestones**: The separate repositories come together at specific points in the process, particularly during the Alignment (Milestone 4) and Harmonization (Milestone 6) phases.

The repository infrastructure is especially important during the Technical Validation (Milestone 3) and Technical Finalization (Milestone 8) phases, where proper organization and integration of components are crucial for successful project completion.

## Workflow Characteristics

The translation workflow has several key characteristics:

1. **Sequential Dependencies**: Certain milestones must be completed before others can begin

2. **Parallel Work Opportunities**: Some components can be developed simultaneously

3. **Quality Gates**: Each milestone includes specific quality assurance measures

4. **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple review and revision cycles for continuous improvement

5. **Collaborative Environment**: Multiple stakeholders contribute throughout the process

## How Our Project Management System Will Support This Process

The Biblical Translation Project Management System we're developing will provide specialized tools to support each aspect of the Book Translation Package Production Process:

### Milestone Tracking

Our application will:
- Guide users through each milestone with clear task assignments
- Track progress and completion of milestone deliverables
- Provide checklists for quality requirements
- Enforce dependencies between milestones

### Repository Integration

Our application will:
- Connect with the DCS repository infrastructure
- Pull status information from repositories
- Facilitate repository operations without requiring Git expertise
- Manage branch protection and review workflows

### Team Coordination

Our application will:
- Assign roles based on expertise and availability
- Track individual and team progress
- Facilitate communication between team members
- Coordinate handoffs between milestones

### Quality Assurance

Our application will:
- Implement validation checks at key points
- Track revisions and improvements
- Provide review workflows
- Generate quality metrics reports

### Resource Management

Our application will:
- Help allocate translators, reviewers, and consultants
- Optimize resource usage across parallel work streams
- Identify bottlenecks and resource constraints
- Project timeline impacts based on resource allocation

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each milestone is available in the Milestones directory:

- [Milestone 1: Drafting Phase](./milestones/milestone1.md)
- [Milestone 2: Initial Review Phase](./milestones/milestone2.md)
- [Milestone 3: Technical Validation Phase](./milestones/milestone3.md)
- [Milestone 4: Alignment Phase](./milestones/milestone4.md)
- [Milestone 5: Supporting Resources Translation Phase](./milestones/milestone5.md)
- [Milestone 6: Harmonization Phase](./milestones/milestone6.md)
- [Milestone 7: Expert Review Phase](./milestones/milestone7.md)
