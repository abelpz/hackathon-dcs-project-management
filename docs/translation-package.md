# Book Translation Package

A Book Translation Package is a comprehensive set of resources designed to enable minority language translators to produce high-quality Bible translations without requiring expertise in the original biblical languages. Our project management application will streamline the creation and management of these packages through the entire translation lifecycle.

## Understanding Book Translation Packages

This section describes the Book Translation Package components and organization to establish the context that our project management application will need to support. By understanding these components and their structure, we can design a system that effectively tracks, manages, and facilitates their creation.

## Key Components

Each Book Translation Package consists of six essential components that work together to provide a complete framework for accurate and clear translation. Our application will need to track the development of each of these components:

### 1. Literal Translation

**Purpose**: Provides a representation of the source text that closely follows the structure of the original biblical languages.

**Contents**:
- Complete text of a biblical book in the gateway language
- Closely mirrors Hebrew/Greek/Aramaic syntax and idioms where possible
- Includes all implicit information from the original texts
- Maintains theological terminology with minimal adaptation

**Benefits**:
- Enables translators to see how the original text is structured
- Serves as a reference point for accuracy checking
- Helps identify where original language features should be preserved

### 2. Simplified Translation

**Purpose**: Offers an easier-to-understand version with simplified grammar and vocabulary while maintaining accuracy.

**Contents**:
- Complete text of a biblical book in the gateway language
- Uses simplified grammar and sentence structures
- Employs common vocabulary and explains complex concepts
- Makes implicit information explicit where needed for clarity
- Restructures complex passages for natural reading

**Benefits**:
- Provides a clear model for natural translation
- Demonstrates how complex concepts can be expressed simply
- Helps translators understand the meaning before translating

### 3. Translation Notes

**Purpose**: Explains difficult passages, cultural concepts, figures of speech, and other translation challenges.

**Contents**:
- Verse-by-verse explanatory notes
- Clarification of ambiguous terms or phrases
- Cultural and historical background information
- Explanation of figurative language
- Alternative translation options for difficult phrases
- Cross-references to related passages

**Benefits**:
- Resolves ambiguities in the source text
- Provides crucial contextual information
- Explains translation decisions made in the literal and simplified versions
- Helps translators handle complex theological concepts accurately

### 4. Translation Dictionary

**Purpose**: Defines key terms, theological concepts, and specialized vocabulary that appear in the biblical book.

**Contents**:
- Comprehensive definitions of theological terms
- Explanations of biblical customs and cultural practices
- Information about places, people, and events
- Guidelines for consistently translating specialized vocabulary
- Cross-references to where terms appear in the text

**Benefits**:
- Ensures consistent translation of key terms
- Provides depth of meaning beyond simple word definitions
- Helps translators understand unfamiliar concepts
- Creates links between related theological ideas

### 5. Translation Academy

**Purpose**: Provides educational articles about translation principles, processes, and best practices.

**Contents**:
- Translation theory fundamentals
- Practical guides for handling common translation challenges
- Quality checking procedures
- Articles on biblical genres and their translation implications
- Technical instructions for tools and formatting

**Benefits**:
- Builds translator capacity and skills
- Standardizes approaches to common translation problems
- Ensures awareness of best practices
- Helps maintain quality across the translation process

### 6. Translation Questions

**Purpose**: Provides comprehension questions for each chapter to verify the clarity and accuracy of the translation.

**Contents**:
- Multiple questions for each chapter of the biblical book
- Focus on key narrative events, teachings, and concepts
- Questions designed to reveal misunderstandings in translation
- Coverage of both explicit and implicit information

**Benefits**:
- Serves as a quality checking tool
- Reveals gaps in comprehension that may indicate translation issues
- Helps verify that implicit information is properly conveyed
- Ensures key theological concepts are accurately translated

## Repository Structure

The Book Translation Package components are organized within Git repositories hosted in the Door43 Content Service (DCS) platform. This structure facilitates collaboration, version control, and resource management throughout the translation process. Our project management application will integrate with this existing infrastructure.

### Organization Structure

Resources are organized under language-specific organizations within DCS. For example, the Spanish (Latin American) Gateway Language resources are organized under the `es-419_gl` organization.

### Component Repositories

Each component of the Book Translation Package is stored in its own dedicated repository. Our application will track progress, manage tasks, and coordinate work across these repositories:

1. **Simplified Books**: `es-419_gl/es-419_gst`
   - Contains the simplified translation text
   - Organized by biblical books
   - Uses USFM (Unified Standard Format Markers) format

2. **Literal Books**: `es-419_gl/es-419_glt`
   - Contains the literal translation text
   - Organized by biblical books
   - Uses USFM format

3. **Translation Notes**: `es-419_gl/es-419_tn`
   - Contains verse-by-verse explanatory notes
   - Organized by biblical books and chapters
   - Uses Markdown format with structured headers

4. **Translation Academy**: `es-419_gl/es-419_ta`
   - Contains translation education articles
   - Organized by categories (process, translate, checking)
   - Uses Markdown format

5. **Translation Words**: `es-419_gl/es-419_tw`
   - Contains the translation dictionary entries
   - Organized alphabetically and by category
   - Uses Markdown format with metadata headers

6. **Translation Questions**: `es-419_gl/es-419_tq`
   - Contains comprehension questions
   - Organized by biblical books and chapters
   - Uses Markdown format

### Advantages of This Structure

This repository structure provides several advantages that our project management application will leverage:

1. **Modularity**: Each component can be developed and maintained independently, allowing our application to track separate work streams
2. **Version Control**: Complete history of changes with attribution, which our application will integrate with for progress tracking
3. **Collaboration**: Multiple contributors can work simultaneously on different components, requiring coordination features in our application
4. **Integration**: APIs and tools can access specific components as needed, which our application will utilize
5. **Scalability**: New language repositories can follow the same pattern, allowing our application to support multiple translation projects

This repository structure is a foundational aspect of the Book Translation Package system, and our project management application will be designed to work seamlessly with this existing infrastructure.

## Development Process

Book Translation Packages are developed through an 8-milestone process that ensures quality, consistency, and completeness of all components. Each milestone builds upon the previous one, with regular quality checks to maintain high standards. Our project management application will guide users through this process, helping them track progress and meet quality requirements at each stage.

The development of a complete Book Translation Package typically takes 6-12 months depending on the complexity and length of the biblical book. Resources are developed in parallel where possible to increase efficiency. Our application will help project managers optimize resource allocation and timeline planning.
