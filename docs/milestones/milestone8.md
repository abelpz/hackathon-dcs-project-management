# Milestone 8: Technical Finalization Phase

The Technical Finalization Phase involves preparing the expert-approved Book Translation Package for publication by ensuring all technical requirements are met, metadata is complete, and the package is properly formatted for distribution through the Door43 Content Service (DCS).

## Description

Technical specialists perform format validation on all resources, complete metadata requirements, verify file structures, and prepare the package for release on git.door43.org. This milestone represents the transition from content development to publication and distribution.

## Participants

- **Technical Publication Specialist**: Expert in DCS publication requirements
- **Metadata Manager**: Ensures complete and accurate metadata
- **Format Validator**: Verifies file formats and structures
- **Quality Assurance Tester**: Tests package functionality
- **Project Manager**: Oversees the finalization process
- **DCS Integration Specialist**: Handles repository configuration

## Methodology

1. **Preparation**: 
   - Assembly of expert-approved package components
   - Compilation of technical requirements checklist
   - Verification of DCS publication standards
   - Setup of validation environment
   - Creation of publication plan

2. **Technical Validation Process**:
   - Systematic format validation of all resources
   - Verification of file naming conventions
   - Checking of file structures and relationships
   - Validation of markup and formatting
   - Testing of cross-references and links
   - Verification of resource completeness
   - Automated validation script execution
   - Confirmation of proper organization within repository structure (ensuring all files are in their appropriate repositories: simplified books in es-419_gst, literal books in es-419_glt, translation notes in es-419_tn, etc.)
   - Validation of file formats (USFM for books, TSV for notes and questions, etc.)

3. **Metadata Completion**:
   - Creation of comprehensive metadata
   - Documentation of package components
   - Assignment of appropriate identifiers
   - Verification of copyright and licensing information
   - Completion of contributor information
   - Addition of version and release data
   - Creation of package documentation

4. **Publication Preparation**:
   - Configuration of DCS repository
   - Organization of file structure for distribution
   - Creation of user documentation
   - Development of release notes
   - Preparation of announcement materials
   - Final quality assurance testing
   - Approval for publication

## Quality Indicators

- **Technical Accuracy**: Correct file formats and structures
- **Metadata Completeness**: All required metadata fields populated
- **Validation Success**: Passing all automated validation checks
- **Resource Integrity**: All components present and functional
- **Accessibility**: Package meets accessibility standards
- **Discoverability**: Appropriate tagging and categorization
- **Documentation**: Clear user guides and release information
- **Repository Compliance**: All resources properly structured in their designated DCS repositories

## Deliverables

- Publication-ready Book Translation Package
- Complete technical validation report
- Comprehensive metadata documentation
- DCS repository configuration
- User documentation and guides
- Release notes and announcements
- Final package verification report

## Dependencies

- Completion of Milestone 7 (Expert Review Phase)
- Access to DCS publication infrastructure
- Technical validation tools and scripts
- Clear metadata requirements and standards

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
