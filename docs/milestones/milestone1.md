# Milestone 1: Drafting Phase

The Drafting Phase is the foundation of the entire translation process. During this milestone, translators create the initial translations of both the literal and simplified versions of the biblical book.

## Components

### 1a. Drafting Literal Book ({lang}_glt)

#### Description
The creation of a literal translation that closely follows the structure of the original biblical languages. The book is divided into chunks (usually verses or small paragraphs) and translated with a focus on maintaining source language patterns where possible.

#### Participants
- **Lead Translator**: Coordinates the translation effort and ensures consistency
- **Translation Specialists**: Translators with expertise in biblical languages and the target strategic language
- **Translation Consultant**: Provides guidance on difficult passages and translation decisions

#### Methodology
1. **Preparation**: 
   - Study of source texts and references
   - Familiarization with book context and themes
   - Terminology discussion and standardization

2. **Chunk Assignment**:
   - Division of book into manageable chunks
   - Assignment of chunks to individual translators
   - Establishment of completion timeline

3. **Translation Process**:
   - Verse-by-verse or chunk-by-chunk translation
   - Prioritizing structural fidelity to original language
   - Preserving word order and grammatical features where possible
   - Maintaining consistent terminology
   - Regular consultation with reference materials

4. **Self-Review**:
   - Translator's self-check against source text
   - Documentation of difficult translation decisions
   - Annotation of passages requiring further discussion

#### Quality Indicators
- **Accuracy**: Faithfulness to source text meaning
- **Completeness**: All content is represented with nothing omitted
- **Consistency**: Uniform handling of repeated terms and phrases
- **Literalness**: Preservation of original language structures where appropriate
- **Annotations**: Clear documentation of translation challenges

#### Deliverables
- Complete literal translation of the book in chunks
- Annotations about difficult passages and translation decisions
- Standardized terminology list used in the translation
- Initial questions for review phases

#### Dependencies
- Source texts and reference materials must be available
- Translators must understand the source language or have quality English resources
- Terminology standards should be established before translation begins

#### Challenges and Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Balancing literalness with comprehensibility | Follow established guidelines for when to prioritize structure vs. meaning |
| Handling idioms and figures of speech | Document these for special attention in review phases |
| Maintaining consistency across translators | Use terminology databases and regular team meetings |
| Technical/theological terms | Consult reference resources and document decisions |

### 1b. Drafting Simplified Book ({lang}_gst)

#### Description
Creating a simplified version that maintains accuracy but uses natural language patterns to enhance comprehension. This version focuses on clear communication of meaning rather than preserving original language structures.

#### Participants
- **Lead Communicator**: Oversees the simplified translation approach
- **Translators**: Specialists in clear communication in the target strategic language
- **Cultural Advisors**: Provide input on effective communication patterns

#### Methodology
1. **Preparation**: 
   - Study of source texts and references
   - Analysis of target audience language needs
   - Development of simplification guidelines

2. **Chunk Assignment**:
   - Assignment of chunks to individual translators
   - Coordination with the literal translation team

3. **Translation Process**:
   - Restructuring complex sentences for clarity
   - Clarifying implicit information explicitly when needed
   - Using common vocabulary appropriate for the audience
   - Maintaining full meaning while simplifying expression
   - Ensuring natural language patterns in the target language

4. **Self-Review**:
   - Check against source text for meaning preservation
   - Evaluation of readability and naturalness
   - Documentation of adaptations and clarifications

#### Quality Indicators
- **Clarity**: Messages are expressed in clear, simple language
- **Naturalness**: Translation follows natural patterns in the target language
- **Readability**: Text is accessible to the intended audience
- **Accuracy**: Despite simplification, the full meaning is preserved
- **Consistency**: Uniform handling of terms and concepts

#### Deliverables
- Complete simplified translation of the book in chunks
- Documentation of simplification strategies
- List of implicit information made explicit
- Readability assessments

#### Dependencies
- Can be developed in parallel with the literal translation
- May reference the literal translation work in progress
- Benefits from established terminology decisions

#### Challenges and Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Simplifying without losing meaning | Regular comparison with source texts |
| Balancing explicitness with brevity | Follow guidelines for when to make implicit information explicit |
| Ensuring natural language patterns | Involve native speakers in the process |
| Consistent level of simplification | Develop clear simplification guidelines and examples |

## Workflow Integration

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Milestones 1a and 1b can be worked on simultaneously
- Milestone 5 (Supporting Resources Translation) can begin in parallel with this phase
- Different chunks of the book can be assigned to different translators for concurrent work

### Input Requirements
- Source texts in original languages or English
- Reference materials and commentaries
- Established project guidelines and standards
- Terminology guidelines and glossaries

### Output Utilization
- Outputs feed directly into Milestone 2 (Initial Review Phase)
- Draft translations serve as reference for Milestone 5 work
- Terminology decisions impact all subsequent milestones

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Software
- Translation editing software with versification support
- Terminology management databases
- Collaborative editing platforms
- Reference material integration

### Reference Materials
- Source language texts and interlinears
- Commentaries and translation handbooks
- Cultural background resources
- Linguistic reference materials

## Progress Tracking

### Metrics
- Percentage of verses/chunks completed
- Number of terms standardized
- Annotations requiring resolution
- Readability scores (for simplified version)

### Quality Checkpoints
- Completion of initial drafts by chunk
- Self-review completed
- Terminology consistency verified
- Ready for peer review
