# Milestone 4: Alignment Phase

The Alignment Phase involves systematically mapping both the literal and simplified translations to the original text to ensure completeness, accuracy, and proper representation of the source material's structure and meaning.

## Components

### 4a. Word Alignment of Literal Book

#### Description
A detailed process of mapping words and phrases in the literal translation to their corresponding elements in the original language texts, creating explicit links between source and target language content that document translation decisions and facilitate quality control.

#### Participants
- **Alignment Specialist**: Expert in word-level alignment techniques
- **Biblical Language Scholar**: Provides source text expertise
- **Lead Translator**: Explains translation decisions
- **Technical Validator**: Ensures alignment quality

#### Methodology
1. **Preparation**: 
   - Setup of alignment tools and environment
   - Preparation of source and target texts in alignable format
   - Identification of alignment principles and standards
   - Training and calibration of alignment team

2. **Alignment Process**:
   - Word-by-word mapping between source and target texts
   - Documentation of word order changes
   - Handling of idioms and non-literal expressions
   - Treatment of implicit information
   - Alignment of discourse markers and connectives
   - Special handling of difficult passages

3. **Quality Control**:
   - Verification of complete coverage
   - Consistency checking across similar constructions
   - Peer review of alignment decisions
   - Evaluation of structural fidelity

4. **Finalization**:
   - Resolution of alignment issues
   - Final verification of completeness
   - Preparation of alignment data for integration
   - Documentation of alignment decisions

#### Quality Indicators
- **Completeness**: All source text elements are accounted for
- **Accuracy**: Correct correspondences between source and target
- **Consistency**: Similar constructions aligned in similar ways
- **Granularity**: Appropriate level of alignment detail
- **Documentation**: Clear records of alignment decisions

#### Deliverables
- Complete word-aligned literal translation
- Alignment data in standardized format
- Documentation of complex alignment decisions
- Statistical report on alignment patterns
- Preparation for harmonization phase

#### Dependencies
- Completion of Milestones 3a and 3b (Technical Validation of Literal Book)
- Access to original language texts in alignable format
- Established alignment standards and methodologies

#### Challenges and Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Handling complex syntactic restructuring | Development of clear guidelines for non-linear alignments |
| Aligning implied information | Documentation system for zero alignments with explanations |
| Maintaining consistency across different aligners | Regular calibration sessions and style guide development |
| Balancing alignment granularity with efficiency | Clear specifications for appropriate alignment level by text type |

### 4b. Word Alignment of Simplified Book

#### Description
Similar to 4a, but focused on aligning the simplified translation to the original text, with special attention to how simplification strategies and restructuring are documented while maintaining traceable connections to the source content.

#### Participants
- **Simplified Alignment Specialist**: Expert in meaning-based alignment
- **Communication Expert**: Provides insight on simplification decisions
- **Original Language Consultant**: Ensures accurate meaning representation
- **Technical Validator**: Ensures alignment quality

#### Methodology
1. **Preparation**: 
   - Reference to literal alignment results
   - Adaptation of alignment tools for simplified text
   - Development of meaning-based alignment standards
   - Training for simplified alignment techniques

2. **Alignment Process**:
   - Meaning-based mapping between source and simplified text
   - Documentation of structural reorganization
   - Tracking of implicit information made explicit
   - Alignment of simplified expressions to original concepts
   - Special handling of cultural adaptations
   - Bridging through literal translation where helpful

3. **Quality Control**:
   - Verification of meaning preservation
   - Consistency checking across similar simplifications
   - Peer review of alignment decisions
   - Evaluation of simplification effectiveness

4. **Finalization**:
   - Resolution of alignment issues
   - Final verification of meaning coverage
   - Preparation of alignment data for integration
   - Documentation of simplification patterns

#### Quality Indicators
- **Meaning Preservation**: Essential concepts from source are represented
- **Traceability**: Clear connection between source and simplified text
- **Consistency**: Similar concepts simplified in similar ways
- **Appropriateness**: Simplification level suitable for target audience
- **Documentation**: Clear records of simplification decisions

#### Deliverables
- Complete meaning-aligned simplified translation
- Simplified alignment data in standardized format
- Documentation of simplification strategies by passage type
- Statistical report on simplification patterns
- Preparation for harmonization phase

#### Dependencies
- Completion of Milestones 3c and 3d (Technical Validation of Simplified Book)
- Results from Milestone 4a for reference
- Established meaning-based alignment standards

#### Challenges and Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Aligning heavily restructured text | Development of multi-level alignment approach |
| Documenting added explicit information | Clear marking and justification system for additions |
| Balancing direct and functional correspondences | Guidelines for determining appropriate alignment type by context |
| Maintaining theological accuracy in simplification | Regular review by theological consultants during alignment |

## Workflow Integration

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Milestones 4a and 4b can be worked on simultaneously if resources permit
- Different sections of text can be aligned by different team members
- Milestone 5 (Supporting Resources Translation) continues in parallel
- Preparation for Milestone 6 (Harmonization) can begin with completed sections

### Input Requirements
- Technically validated translations from Milestone 3
- Source texts in alignable format
- Alignment standards and methodologies
- Key phrase and term documentation from validation phase

### Output Utilization
- Alignment data is essential for Milestone 6 (Harmonization Phase)
- Alignment documentation informs translation notes development
- Word-meaning mappings support dictionary development
- Alignment patterns inform translation academy article creation

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Software
- Specialized alignment tools
- Original language text databases
- Alignment visualization systems
