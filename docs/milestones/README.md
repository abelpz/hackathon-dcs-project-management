# Book Translation Package Production Process: Milestone Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for each of the 8 milestones in the established Book Translation Package Production Process. These descriptions document the existing process that will be supported by our Biblical Translation Project Management System application.

## Established Process Milestones

The Book Translation Package Production Process consists of 8 distinct milestones, each with specific participants, methodologies, quality standards, and deliverables. This process exists independently of our project management application and represents the established methodology used by translation organizations.

## Repository Integration in the Established Process

The 8-milestone process is deeply integrated with the repository structure used in the Door43 Content Service (DCS) platform:

- **Milestones 1-3** focus primarily on the Literal Translation (`es-419_glt`) and Simplified Translation (`es-419_gst`) repositories
- **Milestone 4** establishes connections between these two repositories through alignment
- **Milestone 5** produces content for the Translation Notes (`es-419_tn`), Translation Words (`es-419_tw`), Translation Academy (`es-419_ta`), and Translation Questions (`es-419_tq`) repositories
- **Milestone 6** ensures consistency between all repositories
- **Milestone 7** involves expert review across all repositories
- **Milestone 8** finalizes the technical aspects of all repositories for publication

The modular repository structure enables different teams to work simultaneously on different components while maintaining the dependencies required by the milestone process.

## How Our Project Management System Will Support These Milestones

Our Biblical Translation Project Management System is being designed to support and optimize this established process. Each milestone documented here will inform specific application features:

### Milestone Tracking Features

Our application will provide:
- Task management for each milestone's specific activities
- Progress tracking for milestone completion
- Quality checklists based on milestone standards
- Resource allocation tools for milestone-specific roles

### Repository Integration Features

Our application will provide:
- Connection to the appropriate repositories for each milestone
- Tools for working with the correct formats (USFM, Markdown)
- Version control interfaces appropriate to milestone activities
- Cross-repository coordination for integration points

### Role-Based Features

Our application will support:
- Appropriate user roles for each milestone (e.g., drafters, reviewers, validators)
- Role-specific dashboards and interfaces
- Collaboration tools for role interactions
- Handoff workflows between roles across milestones

### Quality Assurance Features

Our application will implement:
- Milestone-specific validation rules
- Quality metrics reporting
- Review workflows appropriate to each milestone
- Documentation of quality decisions

## Milestone Information That Will Inform Application Development

Each milestone document provides comprehensive information that will directly inform our application features, including:

- **Components and sub-processes**: Will be reflected in the task breakdown within our application
- **Participants and their roles**: Will inform the user roles and permissions in our application
- **Detailed methodologies**: Will be incorporated into process guidelines and help documentation
- **Quality indicators**: Will be implemented as quality checkpoints and validation rules
- **Deliverables and requirements**: Will be tracked as milestone completion criteria
- **Dependencies and prerequisites**: Will be enforced through workflow rules in our application
- **Common challenges and solutions**: Will inform error-handling and guidance features
- **Workflow integration**: Will determine how milestones connect in the application interface
- **Tools and resources**: Will be integrated or linked from our application
- **Progress tracking metrics**: Will be implemented in dashboard and reporting features

## Milestone Documents

These detailed milestone documents describe the established process and will serve as the foundation for developing specific features in our application:

1. [Milestone 1: Drafting Phase](./milestone1.md)
2. [Milestone 2: Initial Review Phase](./milestone2.md)
3. [Milestone 3: Technical Validation Phase](./milestone3.md)
4. [Milestone 4: Alignment Phase](./milestone4.md)
5. [Milestone 5: Supporting Resources Translation Phase](./milestone5.md)
6. [Milestone 6: Harmonization Phase](./milestone6.md)
7. [Milestone 7: Expert Review Phase](./milestone7.md)
8. [Milestone 8: Technical Finalization Phase](./milestone8.md)

While our application will initially focus on supporting the Book Translation Package Production Process, its architecture will be designed to eventually support other translation processes with different milestone structures, such as direct Minority Language Bible Translation.
