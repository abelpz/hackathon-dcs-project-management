# Biblical Translation Project Management Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation describes the context and requirements for developing a Biblical Translation Project Management System - an application that doesn't exist yet but is being designed to facilitate the creation, management, and distribution of Bible translation resources for minority language communities.

## Key Distinction: Process vs. System

It's important to understand the distinction between two related but separate concepts:

### 1. Book Translation Package Production Process

This is the established 8-milestone methodology and workflow used for creating comprehensive translation resources. This process:
- Is already defined and practiced by translation organizations
- Involves specific steps from drafting to publication
- Has established quality standards and deliverables
- Requires coordination of multiple contributors with different roles
- Uses a structured repository framework in Door43 Content Service

### 2. Biblical Translation Project Management System

This is the application we're designing and building to:
- Support and streamline the Book Translation Package Production Process
- Provide digital tools to manage, track, and optimize the workflow
- Facilitate coordination among distributed team members
- Integrate with the existing Door43 Content Service infrastructure
- Eventually support other translation processes (like Minority Language Bible Translation)

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive project management tool that will streamline the process of creating Book Translation Packages. These packages enable translators to work from "gateway" languages (like Spanish or Portuguese) to their own minority languages, without requiring knowledge of the original biblical languages.

The documentation outlines how translation resources are currently organized in a structured repository framework within the Door43 Content Service (DCS) platform, where each component (Literal Translation, Simplified Translation, Translation Notes, etc.) is maintained in its own dedicated Git repository. Our project management application will integrate with this existing infrastructure to enable better coordination, tracking, and quality control throughout the translation process.

## Purpose of This Documentation

This documentation serves several purposes:

1. **Contextual Understanding**: Provides the necessary background on Bible translation challenges and the Book Translation Package approach for stakeholders and developers
2. **Requirements Specification**: Outlines the processes, workflows, and dependencies that the project management application must support
3. **Development Guide**: Informs the design and implementation of the application features
4. **Integration Reference**: Documents how the application should interact with the existing DCS infrastructure

## Documentation Sections

### [Overview](./overview.md)
General information about the project purpose, challenges faced by minority language translators, and our solution through the Book Translation Package approach.

### [Book Translation Package](./translation-package.md)
Detailed explanation of the six components that make up a Book Translation Package, their purposes, and how they work together to facilitate translation. This section also covers how these components are organized in the repository structure.

### [Translation Process](./translation-process.md)
Description of the 8-milestone translation process from drafting to publication, including stakeholders, methodologies, and quality standards for each milestone that the application will need to track and facilitate.

### [Workflow Visualization](./workflow.md)
Diagrams and explanations of dependencies between different milestones and components, parallel work opportunities, and critical path analysis that will inform the project management features.

### [Technical Details](./technical.md)
Information about the planned technical stack, API integration with Door43 Content Service, system architecture, data model, security considerations, deployment strategy, and repository structure.

### [Milestone Documentation](./milestones/)
Detailed documentation for each of the 8 milestones in the translation process, including participants, methodologies, quality indicators, and deliverables that the application will need to manage.

## Application Vision

The Biblical Translation Project Management System we aim to build will:

- **Streamline Workflow**: Guide users through the 8-milestone process with clear task assignments and deadlines
- **Track Progress**: Provide real-time visibility into the status of each component and milestone
- **Manage Resources**: Help allocate translators, reviewers, and consultants efficiently
- **Ensure Quality**: Implement checkpoints and validation processes throughout the workflow
- **Facilitate Collaboration**: Enable distributed teams to work together effectively
- **Integrate with DCS**: Seamlessly interact with the existing repository infrastructure

## Future Process Support

While initially focused on supporting the Book Translation Package Production Process, our system is being designed with extensibility in mind. Future versions will aim to support:

- **Minority Language Bible Translation**: Direct translation from gateway languages to minority languages
- **Other Translation Projects**: Supporting different methodologies and resource types
- **Custom Workflows**: Allowing organizations to define their own processes while maintaining quality control

## Getting Started

If you're new to this project, we recommend:

1. Start with the [Overview](./overview.md) to understand the project context
2. Explore the [Book Translation Package](./translation-package.md) to learn about the core resources
3. Review the [Translation Process](./translation-process.md) to understand the workflow the application will manage
4. See the [Technical Details](./technical.md) to understand the planned system architecture

## Disclaimer

This project will utilize the Door43 Content Service (DCS) API to interact with biblical translation resources. While it will integrate with the DCS ecosystem, it is not officially affiliated with Door43. DCS is an open-source platform that provides version control and collaboration tools for open-licensed content, particularly biblical resources.
